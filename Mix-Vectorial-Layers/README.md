# Mix-Vectorial-Layers
In this part of the project, we obtain the census of Don Álvaro and the smallest rectangle that frames it, all using the R programming language. From the clipping, we create new vector layers with vector layers obtained from IDEEX.es, using QGIS software.

> 💡: **At the end of the readme, you will find the download link for all the layers.**

> 📑: **You can consult a detailed study** [HERE](Obtain-Define-Geographic-Information.pdf).

## Vector layers on topics

### Education & Towns
We display population areas and educational buildings.

# Cartographic grids framing the towns's census
We observe that the towns's census requires two cartographic grids to be fully covered. This indicates that in the following sections, we may need to work with both and trim them.
